<h1>Clustering</h1>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique used to group similar data points together
    based on their features. The goal is to discover natural patterns in the data, such that objects within
    the same group are more alike to each other than to those in different groups. There are two main clusering
    approaches: partitional clustering and hierarchical clustering. Partitional methods, such as k-means, split
    the dataset into a specified number of clusters by iteratively assigning points to the nearest cluster center
    and updating those centers. Hierarchical clustering builds a nested tree of clusters, either by starting with
    each data point as its own cluster and merging them step by step, or by starting with all points in
    one cluster and splitting them recursively. Both partitional and hierarchical clustering rely on distance
    metrics to measure similarity between data points. Common metrics include Euclidean distance (straight-line
    distance), Manhattan distance (sum of absolute differences), and cosine similarity (angle between vectors).
    The choice of clustering method and distance metric has a strong influence on the shapes and types of clusters
    that are discovered.<p>

    <p>In the context of this project, rides can be clustered by their average and peak wait times, variability, and ride type
    to uncover categories such as “thrill rides with consistently long waits,” “family-friendly rides with steady moderate waits,”
    and “low-wait seasonal attractions.” Similarly, clustering entire days using features like crowd index, weather, and average
    waits might reveal distinct types of guest experiences, such as quiet off-season weekdays, moderate crowd days, or high-intensity
    holiday peaks. By applying clustering in these ways, this project can surface hidden patterns and relationships within the
    data that help explain how crowds and waits evolve across different rides, times, and conditions.<p>

    <h3>Data Prep</h3>
    <p>All models and methods require specific data formats. For example, supervised models like decision trees or neural
        networks require labeled data, where each observation has both input features and an output label to learn from.
        Clustering is an unsupervised learning method and therefore requires only unlabeled numeric data (a set of features
        that describe each observation). The algorithm then measures the distance between data points using metrics such
        as Euclidean distance, and groups points into clusters based on how close they are in feature space. This requirement
        for numeric data is important, because clustering relies on mathematical operations (like calculating distances)
        that are only meaningful with numbers. If your dataset includes non-numeric values such as categorical labels or text,
        they must first be transformed into a numeric representation before clustering can be applied. </p>

        for clustering:</p>

    <h3>Results</h3>

    <h4>K-Means Clustering</h4>
    <img src="{{ url_for('static', path='figures/silhouette_method.png') }}" alt="silhouette method" width="600">
    <img src="{{ url_for('static', path='figures/k_means_clustered_k_2.png') }}" alt="k-means clustered k = 2" width="600">
    <img src="{{ url_for('static', path='figures/k_means_clustered_k_3.png') }}" alt="k-means clustered k = 3" width="600">
    <img src="{{ url_for('static', path='figures/k_means_clustered_k_4.png') }}" alt="k-means clustered k = 4" width="600">
    <img src="{{ url_for('static', path='figures/k_means_clustered_k_5.png') }}" alt="k-means clustered k = 5" width="600">

    <p>Using k-means clustering, the silhouette analysis showed that k = 2 provides the best clustering solution, meaning the data naturally separates
        into two clear groups. These clusters represent quiet to moderately busy days and peak busy days, offering a simple
        but powerful distinction. While other visualizations with k = 3, 4, or 5 revealed more granular splits—such as
        separating different levels of moderate days—these additional clusters were less distinct and added complexity
        (even overfitting with k = 5) without clear interpretive benefit. By contrast, k = 2 maximizes cluster cohesion and
        separation, giving the most meaningful and interpretable grouping for understanding overall crowd patterns in the parks.</p>

    <h4>Hierarchical Clustering</h4>
    <img src="{{ url_for('static', path='figures/hierarchical_clustering_(k=2).png') }}" alt="hierarchical cluserting k=2" width="600">
    <img src="{{ url_for('static', path='figures/dendrogram.png') }}" alt="dendrogram" width="600">
    <img src="{{ url_for('static', path='figures/silhouette_scores.png') }}" alt="hierarchical silhouette scores" width="600">

    <p>Using hierarchical clustering, the silhouette analysis shows that the best separation is achieved with k = 2, where the
        silhouette score is highest (~0.79). This suggests that the data naturally forms two strong clusters under cosine
        similarity. The scatter plot confirms this, showing one group of quiet-to-moderate wait days and another cluster of
        higher-wait days. Unlike k-means, which partitions around centroids, hierarchical clustering emphasizes the relative
        similarity between all pairs of days, and cosine distance in particular groups days with similar shapes of wait patterns
        rather than just magnitudes. The dendrogram further supports this interpretation, showing two major branches where days
        within each branch are tightly related. </p>

    <p>Overall, the hierarchical results align with the k-means outcome, but the dendrogram provides added interpretability by
        revealing how days merge step by step, making it clear that Disney park days tend to fall into two distinct categories:
        less crowded versus heavily crowded.</p>


    <h3>Conclusions</h3>
    <p>Applying both k-means and hierarchical clustering provided consistent and meaningful insights into daily Disney park patterns.
        Despite using different clustering methods, both methods converged on the finding that the data naturally separates into two
        main categories of days. These clusters represent quiet-to-moderate crowd days and high-intensity crowd days, confirming that
        wait times and guest experiences at Disney parks are not evenly distributed but instead fall into clear, recurring patterns.
        This outcome is valuable for the project because it demonstrates that unsupervised methods can uncover underlying structures
        in the data without prior labels. By identifying these distinct day types, the analysis helps frame the broader goal of the
        project: improving understanding of crowd behavior and wait time dynamics in theme parks. These results suggest that future
        predictive models could benefit from recognizing and adapting to these natural day groupings, ultimately offering more
        accurate and practical tools for managing expectations and planning park visits.</p>
