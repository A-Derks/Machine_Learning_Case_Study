<h1>Data Prep</h1>
<p>For this project, I gathered data from multiple publicly available sources that specialize in reporting or
    archiving Disney park wait times and crowd levels. The first source was WDW Passport (https://wdwpassport.com/past-crowds),
    which provides daily historical crowd index scores (1–10 scale) for each day of the year, making it useful for
    analyzing how busy the parks were on specific dates. The second source was the Queue-Times API (https://queue-times.com),
    which exposes real-time JSON feeds of ride-level wait times across theme parks worldwide, including Walt Disney
    World. The core endpoint used was https://queue-times.com/parks/{park_id}/queue_times.json where {park_id}
    corresponds to a specific park, such as 6 for Magic Kingdom. For example, calling GET https://queue-times.com/parks/6/queue_times.json
    returns all current ride wait times at Magic Kingdom in JSON format, including fields for ride names, lands,
    wait times, and whether rides are open or closed. I have written a cron job to scrape the Queue-Times API every
    15 minutes for the rest of the semester to collect a sufficient amount of wait time data. These two sources
    together provided both historical daily crowd-level data and real-time ride-level wait times. Collecting
    from these sites allowed me to compile a dataset that reflected both long-term patterns and up-to-the-minute
    guest experiences, making it possible to study wait times in a way that is both practical and rooted in
    real-world park conditions.

    **Note that for the purpose of part 1 of this project, I collected data from WDW Passport from May 2025 to September
    2025. However, the Queue-Times data is only real time data, so I only have data from September 1, 2025 onward.
    As time goes on and more data is collected, I will only use data from September 1 onwards from both data sources.</p>
