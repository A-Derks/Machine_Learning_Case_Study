<h1>Data Prep</h1>
<p>For this project, I gathered data from multiple publicly available sources that specialize in reporting or
    archiving Disney park wait times and crowd levels. The first source was <a href="https://wdwpassport.com/past-crowds">WDW Passport</a>,
    which provides daily historical crowd index scores (1â€“10 scale) for each day of the year, making it useful for
    analyzing how busy the parks were on specific dates. The second source was the <a href="https://queue-times.com">Queue-Times API</a>,
    which exposes real-time JSON feeds of ride-level wait times across theme parks worldwide, including Walt Disney
    World. The core endpoint used was https://queue-times.com/parks/{park_id}/queue_times.json where {park_id}
    corresponds to a specific park, such as 6 for Magic Kingdom. For example, calling GET https://queue-times.com/parks/6/queue_times.json
    returns all current ride wait times at Magic Kingdom in JSON format, including fields for ride names, lands,
    wait times, and whether rides are open or closed. I have written a cron job to scrape the Queue-Times API every
    15 minutes for the rest of the semester to collect a sufficient amount of wait time data. These two sources
    together provided both historical daily crowd-level data and real-time ride-level wait times. Collecting
    from these sites allowed me to compile a dataset that reflected both long-term patterns and up-to-the-minute
    guest experiences, making it possible to study wait times in a way that is both practical and rooted in
    real-world park conditions.

    **Note that for the purpose of part 1 of this project, I collected data from WDW Passport from May 2025 to September
    2025. However, the Queue-Times data is only real time data, so I only have data from September 1, 2025 onward.
    As time goes on and more data is collected, I will only use data from September 1 onwards from both data sources.</p>
